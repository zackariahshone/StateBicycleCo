                        <p>The game has changed. We are proud to offer a State Bicycle at a price of $299. We’ve heard from
                            our customers that buying their first bike has it's own set of challenges with cost being the
                            main concern. The Core-Line bikes deliver a solid build with endless value and will enable the
                            first time buyers to throw a leg over a State Bicycle. We feel that The Core-Line is a stepping
                            stone into the brand, for the low investment, the rider gets a solid build that will last and a
                            clean finish that will turn heads. Each model features a durable steel frame built with quality
                            components, a flip-flop hub to easily switch between riding fixed or freewheel, and Vans grips
                            for an added touch of style! Plus, all bikes come with a 5-Year Manufacturer Warranty!
